## About Doctelligence

**Doctelligence** is a decentralized, peer-to-peer protocol designed to enable AI and data marketplace ecosystems. It allows parties to securely train AI models and interact with data while ensuring data remains where it originates — without transferring or exposing it. This infrastructure promotes decentralized AI innovation and the efficient monetization of data, while prioritizing privacy and security.

Doctelligence utilizes a decentralized network of validators to maintain security, trust, and transparency. It's designed to provide decentralized AI applications with scalable, robust infrastructure and offers stablecoin rewards for ecosystem participants.

## Features

### 1. **Data Ownership & Utilization**
Doctelligence ensures that data remains securely under the ownership of its creator. Data can be leveraged for training AI models in a decentralized, privacy-preserving way — without ever moving the data.

### 2. **Peer-to-Peer Decentralized Network**
The Doctelligence protocol allows applications and ecosystems to interact directly with data and AI models via a peer-to-peer network. This removes the need for intermediaries, ensuring secure, efficient collaboration.

### 3. **Stablecoin Rewards for Ecosystem Participants**
Participants in the Doctelligence network — including data owners, AI developers, and validators — can earn **stablecoin rewards** for their contributions. This incentive structure ensures fair and transparent compensation.

## Roadmap

The **Doctelligence Roadmap** outlines the phases of protocol development and ecosystem growth, from initial development to full decentralization. It is a community-driven document that is refined based on feedback and evolving needs.

Each phase includes key milestones like:

- Initial development and whitepaper release
- Testnet deployment and ecosystem growth
- Mainnet launch and governance decentralization
- Long-term innovation and real-world applications
