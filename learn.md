**Doctelligence** is a **peer-to-peer protocol and network infrastructure** designed to enable decentralized AI ecosystems and **data marketplace applications**. It allows participants to securely collaborate and innovate in the AI space, while ensuring that data remains in its original location, reducing the need for data movement or sharing.

At the core of Doctelligence is the ability to **train AI models securely** while leveraging **any data, anywhere**. Doctelligence creates a secure environment for collaboration across different parties and industries, allowing for model training and AI development without compromising data privacy.

### How Doctelligence Works

- **For AI Developers**: Doctelligence provides secure, decentralized access to a broad range of data sources for training AI models. Through its protocol, AI developers can train models without the need to move or expose sensitive data, ensuring privacy and efficiency.

- **For Data Owners**: Data owners retain **full ownership** and control over their data while being able to monetize it by contributing to the decentralized network. Doctelligence enables seamless collaboration without the need to relinquish control or expose their data.
