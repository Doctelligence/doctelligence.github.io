**Doctelligence** is pioneering research in decentralized AI, data privacy, and blockchain technologies to create secure, efficient ecosystems for AI development and data collaboration. Our research focuses on advancing privacy, data sovereignty, and decentralized networks to empower AI developers, data owners, and ecosystem participants.

#### 1. **Enabling Federated Learning in Decentralized Data Ecosystems**
- **Protocol Design for Federated Learning**: Our research focuses on developing protocols that enable seamless Federated Learning (FL) processes within decentralized data ecosystems, supporting privacy-preserving collaboration while ensuring scalability and efficiency in model training.

#### 2. **Data Privacy & Security**
- **Privacy-Preserving AI**: We investigate methods for training AI models without compromising data privacy, ensuring that data can be securely shared within decentralized ecosystems while maintaining control over it.

#### 3. **Blockchain & Incentives**
- **Blockchain for Security and Rewards**: We explore how blockchain and smart contracts can secure decentralized ecosystems and automate processes like data access, rewards distribution, and governance, fostering fair and sustainable participation through stablecoin incentives.
