**Doctelligence** is focused on advancing decentralized healthcare by empowering individuals with full control over their **personal health records (PHRs)**. By leveraging a **peer-to-peer network** and **AI protocols**, we are creating a system that enhances healthcare delivery while maintaining data privacy and security.

### Key Areas of Research

1. **Personal Health Data Control & Integrated Healthcare Services**  
   - Researching methods to give individuals full control over their health records, enabling seamless integration of health data into healthcare services while preserving privacy and security. This approach allows for better coordination of care across different providers.

2. **Federated Learning for Healthcare AI**  
   - Investigating how federated learning (FL) can be applied to healthcare AI, enabling the training of AI models directly on encrypted health data across the network. This allows for advanced AI-driven insights without compromising patient privacy.

3. **Decentralized Insurance & Reward Systems**  
   - Exploring how blockchain technology and decentralized networks can support **health insurance** models, where individuals can participate in and contribute to decentralized health insurance systems, while earning **stablecoin rewards** for their data contributions.
