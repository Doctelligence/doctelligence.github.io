# How to Use Doctelligence

**Doctelligence** is designed to seamlessly integrate with **EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystems**, empowering decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts with **federated learning capabilities**. Whether you‚Äôre a developer, a data owner, a blockchain ecosystem manager, or part of a decentralized application, Doctelligence provides the infrastructure for secure, privacy-preserving AI collaboration without compromising control or ownership.

Here‚Äôs how you can use Doctelligence in your own projects:

---

### For Blockchain Ecosystems

As an **EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystem** manager or developer, you can leverage Doctelligence to integrate federated learning capabilities into your blockchain infrastructure, enabling secure and decentralized AI model training, data collaboration, and reward distribution directly within your ecosystem.

- **Federated Learning Infrastructure**: Enable your ecosystem to support decentralized AI by allowing developers and data owners to collaborate without ever transferring or exposing data.
- **Native Integration with dApps**: Allow dApp developers to build smart contracts that use Doctelligence‚Äôs federated learning protocol, enabling secure AI collaborations and data-driven insights within the decentralized network.
- **On-Chain Data Collaboration**: Facilitate direct, trustless interactions between data owners and AI developers, with full transparency and control of data.

**Getting Started**:
1. Integrate Doctelligence‚Äôs protocol into your **EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystem** via smart contracts and APIs.
2. Enable decentralized AI model training and secure data collaboration by offering Doctelligence‚Äôs federated learning features to dApp developers.
3. Support data sovereignty by allowing users to contribute data without transferring it off-chain, while still participating in AI model training.
4. Implement **stablecoin rewards** and other incentives for data contributors and developers within your ecosystem.

### For Blockchain Developers

Integrate Doctelligence into your **EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystem** to enable decentralized AI and data collaboration directly within your blockchain applications. 

- **Federated Learning Support**: Add federated learning functionalities to your dApps, allowing them to interact with distributed data sources without transferring the data itself.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Enable users (data owners) to maintain control over their data, while still participating in collaborative AI training.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Leverage Doctelligence‚Äôs on-chain protocol for managing contributions, rewards, and updates, ensuring full transparency and security.

**Getting Started**:
1. [Explore Doctelligence‚Äôs documentation](https://doctelligence.github.io/docs/) to integrate the protocol into your smart contracts.
2. Use Doctelligence‚Äôs built-in features for **on-chain coordination** of federated learning tasks and data interactions.
3. Customize your dApp‚Äôs logic to reward contributors with stablecoins and ensure data sovereignty compliance.

### For AI Developers

If you‚Äôre an AI developer looking to train models on decentralized data without compromising privacy or ownership, Doctelligence provides a simple, secure, and scalable solution.

- **Train Models on Data Where It Lives**: With Doctelligence, you can train models directly on decentralized data sources ‚Äî no need to transfer sensitive data.
- **Access Diverse Data Pools**: Connect to a wide range of high-quality, privacy-preserving datasets in EVM-compatible ecosystems.
- **Secure, Transparent Collaboration**: Share model updates with full auditability, ensuring that data privacy and ownership are preserved at all times.

**Getting Started**:
1. Set up your AI model‚Äôs training process using Doctelligence's decentralized network for federated learning.
2. Ensure that your model's updates and evaluations are processed on-chain or through secure enclaves to maintain privacy.
3. Use **smart contracts** to manage the sharing of model updates and distribution of rewards.

### For Data Owners

As a data owner, Doctelligence offers an innovative way to share your data for AI model training while keeping full control over it. You never need to transfer or expose your data.

- **Data Sovereignty**: You decide when and how your data is used, ensuring full control and privacy.
- **Secure Rewards**: Earn stablecoins for your participation in federated learning tasks, without relying on intermediaries.
- **Transparent Auditing**: Have full visibility and traceability of how your data is being used, with cryptographic guarantees for compliance with data regulations.

**Getting Started**:
1. Connect your data to Doctelligence's protocol through a simple integration with supported dApps or smart contracts.
2. Choose the datasets and model training tasks you‚Äôd like to contribute to, and track your contributions on-chain.
3. Receive **stablecoin rewards** as compensation for your data‚Äôs involvement in federated learning.

### Example Use Case: Decentralized AI for Healthcare

Imagine a decentralized healthcare ecosystem where **Personal Health Records (PHRs)** are stored securely in **Personal Data Stores (PDSs)**. Data owners (patients) can **monetize their health data** by participating in AI model training without giving up control of their data.

- **Step 1**: Healthcare providers (or AI developers) submit models that need training.
- **Step 2**: Data owners contribute their health data to the training process without transferring it ‚Äî keeping full control.
- **Step 3**: AI models are trained, evaluated, and aggregated securely on the blockchain.
- **Step 4**: Data owners earn **stablecoins** as rewards for allowing their data to contribute to training AI models that improve healthcare outcomes.

This example illustrates how Doctelligence enables **secure, transparent, and incentivized AI collaboration** in sensitive sectors like healthcare while preserving data sovereignty.

### Key Benefits of Using Doctelligence

- **No Data Movement**: Data stays local and sovereign, never leaving the data owner‚Äôs device or storage.
- **Decentralized**: There are no central authorities or federated managers ‚Äî everything is coordinated through the blockchain.
- **Built-in Incentives**: Contributors are rewarded with stablecoins for their participation, without needing intermediaries.
- **Composable**: Easily integrates into any EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystem or decentralized application.
- **Privacy First**: Uses cryptographic methods like secure aggregation to ensure privacy-preserving data collaborations.
