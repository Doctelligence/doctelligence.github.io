(Under Construction)
This living roadmap outlines the strategic phases of Doctelligence, focusing on decentralized AI infrastructure, secure collaboration, and community-driven innovation. It will evolve with feedback and new opportunities to stay aligned with our growing ecosystem.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Initial Development

### 📄 Whitepaper Release (Completed 2024)
- Refine and expand the Whitepaper to reflect the latest advancements in the Doctelligence protocol and decentralized ecosystem. (✓)

### 🧪 Prototype Development (Completed 2024)
- Deploy live prototypes on GitHub and conduct experiments on advanced computing clusters in Oxford University, ensuring optimal network performance for decentralized AI. (✓)

### 📅 Presentations at Key AI & Blockchain Events (Ongoing)
- Submit, be recognized, and present at key events for industry traction e.g. so far Doctelligence has been selected for speaker presentations at RDI Berkeley (August 2024), NYC's DeAI event (June 2025), and ETH Denver (March 2025) to update community on Doctelligence roadmap & developments. (✓)

### 🌐 Proof of Concept (PoC) Development (Deadline: 31st May - On Schedule)
- PoC development to lay the groundwork for Testnet infrastructure.  Develop the early testnet PoC with core community involvement members in DAO, testing the foundational components with unit tests and experiments, and ensuring early-stage ecosystem viability. (In Progress)

### ⚡ EVM Compatible Blockchain Integration
- Partner with EVM compatible blockchain for enhanced scalability and adoption (e.g. Sei, EigenLayer, etc). Protocol remains chain agnostic. (-)

---

## Phase 2: Protocol Enhancement & Ecosystem Growth (Begins June 1st)

### 🔗 Early Testnet Development (Deadline: July 31st)
- Rapidly develop and deploy a high-performance **Doctelligence** Testnet with , ensuring scalability and security. (-)

### 🏢 Private Token Sale (July 1st)
- Set up the foundation and initiate the **Token Generation Event (TGE)** to support decentralized growth.
- Jurisdiction to be located in Switzerland, Geneva, as foundation entity (representee needed).
- Details of allocation remain decentralized <20% to insiders with two private rounds; one main and one buffer upon futher Testnet Development as risk buffer and growth in valuation.

### 🤖 Integrate AI & Data Ecosystems
- Enable seamless AI and data integrations with decentralized frameworks like **OpenMined** and **SOLID**. (-)
- Pilot programmes targeting leveraging existing network e.g. SOLID (https://solidproject.org, adecentralized data infrastructure), DePHY (a decentralized DePIN e.g. use on-home devices that people can monetize), ReflexDAO (monetizable health data), OpenMined (FL Ecosystem parnterhsips), Flower Labs (FL ecosystems).

### 👩‍💻 Expand Development Team
- Increase team capacity to expedite protocol development and scale the infrastructure.
- Specific onboarding including blockchain developers, FL mechanics engineers, UX designers for testnet interface, community manager (-)

### 📅 Community Engagement at Major Events
- Leverage existing netowrks to actively engage in key speaking events like **DevCon**, **Oxford Blockchain Sociert**, **DeSCI Summits**, **ETHGlobal**, **Encode Club hackathons**, and **DeAI NYC** to foster growth and awareness. (-)

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced Testnet Protocol Development, Developer Ecosystem (Begin August 1st 2025)

### 🚀 Enhanced Testnet Deployments & Feedback
- Launch the Testnet and collect actionable feedback from developers, validators, and ecosystem participants for further refinement. (-)

### 🧑‍💻 Developer Tools & Data Integration
- Release APIs, SDKs, and prebuilt models for easy integration, accelerating AI development in the decentralized space. (-)

### 🔗 Staking Ecosystem & DPoS
- Implement validator staking and develop a **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)** system to secure and decentralize the network in the testnetwork. (-)

### 🔧 Protocol Optimization & Auditing
- Continuously optimize the protocol and conduct security audits to ensure robust performance. (-)

### 🎉 TGE, Foundation Establishment, Token Airdrop ()
- TGE with Distribute tokens to early participants and key network contributors including validators, FL enineers building or experimenting on the netowrk, and data providers who integrate with the protocol Testnetwork infrastructure to incentivize contributions and grow value of the token by incentivisng users of the protocol network. (-)
- Public ICO for non-contributors to be reserved for discussion at the time

### 🌍 Expand Ecosystem Partnerships
- Form key partnerships with leading decentralized protocols that can leverage the protcol; we imagine these will become clearer from early ecosystems we engage and build on.
- Exsiting protocols with data onboarded ecosystems e.g. Ocean Protocol, AGI ALliance (Fetch.ai, SingularityNet.ai, Ocean Protocl, etc).
- Specific Self-Sovereign Ecosystems (e.g. Cheqd.io, etc).
- Inviting developer communities leveraging **Encode Club**, **OpenMined**, and **FlowerLabs**, and host hackathons to drive ecosystem growth. (-)

---

## Phase 4: Mainnet Deployment & Decentralization

### 🖥️ Mainnet Launch
- Deploy the **Doctelligence** Mainnet, establishing a decentralized, public infrastructure that generates network fees and supports long-term value to return to DAO and shared with any public goods ecosystem partners . (-)

### 🏛️ Governance & Ownership Decentralization
- Transition governance to the community DAO with non-coin procedures and improvement proposals established with clear documentation, making **Doctelligence** a fully decentralized network. (-)

### 🌍 AI for Decentralized Networks
- Foster R&D to advance FL technologies that support decentralized ecosystems, accelerating innovation across sectors like health, smart cities, Depin, etc. (-)

### 💸 Token & Development Fund Management
- Development funds to be accrued from token treasury driven by Foundation as aligned with core values and obliged to steer based on protocol values and decentrlization.  
- Manage funds transparently to drive the ecosystem's growth through decentralized resource allocation. (-)

### 🌍 Cross-Chain Integration of Infrastructure
- Integrate **Doctelligence** with other decentralized infrastructures, enabling cross-chain compatibility and further expanding the ecosystem. (-)

### 🛠️ Community-Driven Development & Feedback Loops
